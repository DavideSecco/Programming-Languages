{- Implement getVarNoRepL function printing length * length â€“ 1 two-element lists (variations without repetitions), 
where lenght = number of elements of the list passed as a parameter. Each such 2-element list includes all possible 2 
element variants without repetitions of input list elements. The program takes in turn the elements from the list given 
as a parameter and adds to each of them one other element from the list, without repeating. For example: 
getVarNoRepL [1,2,3] should return: [[1,2],[1,3],[2,1],[2,3],[3,1],[3,2]] -}
