1. Objects have properties
To examine the properties of a Smalltalk object, use the Inspector: Evaluate each of the following lines separately with Inspect it from the <operate> menu:

3 @ 5										"Returns a Point object as indicated in the label at the top of the Inspector window. Its components are shown below."
Rectangle origin: (3 @ 5) corner: (25@30)	"Returns a Rectangle object."
3 / 5										"Returns a Fraction."

If an object has properties they are, of course, again objects because everything is an object. As an example, the rectangle returned by the second line is a 
composite object with components called origin and corner and these components are objects (points) with their own properties. To see their structure, select the
line with the name and execute Dive in the <operate> menu of the list. To return to the previous Inspector level, execute Back in the <operate> menu or use the arrow
button at the top of the Inspector. Play with the Inspector to discover its basic functionality and read the documentation or on-line help to learn more about it.

2. Every object is an instance of a class
Note that Smalltalk class names always begin with a capital letter.

3. Use the Browser to view class definitions

Smalltalk's tool for viewing, editing, creating, and destroying class definitions is called the Browser. VisualWorks provides several kinds of browsers and you can open 
them from the Launcher: Browse -> System or clicking the button with a baloon and glasses opens the most common Refactoring Browser. You can also open a browser by sending 
a message such as
